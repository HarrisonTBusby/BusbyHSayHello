This program takes a user input and the console says, "Hello (your name)."

I used a while loop for if you want to play again, data validation, and user input to create the program.
Peer Review: Jermy Lapham. Program works great just as intended found no problems the loop ends when I tell it no but keeps going if I say anything else. Great stuff here
